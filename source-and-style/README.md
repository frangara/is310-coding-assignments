What Web Technologies were used to build this tool?

I can see a lot of css and html elements in this digital archive. The thing that I noticed the most was when I clicked on body, I can see how things are all laid out in this website. For example, I can see clearly that there is a "browse-images", "header", and "tabs" that are in this inspect element tab. The thing that I dont recognize is this:

<div id="screen-reader-notification" class="visuallyhidden" role="alert" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="false" aria-relevant="additions"></div>

I can see how this is hidden as to not show up normally but this is cool to see something behind the scences.


Who built this website?

From looking around I can see that jstor built this. This is from the link here:
